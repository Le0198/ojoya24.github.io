										<h3>New Member Round Table</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Sundays | 5:00pm - 6:00pm </h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span><h3>What does the New Member Roundtable Do?</h3>
										<p>The New Member Roundtable is the introductory committee that consists primarily of freshmen and sophomores. It is the responsibility and tradition of the New Member Roundtable to fulfill the five pillars of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. The RT works alongside their Internal Vice-President, each other and from previous RT’s to make their events successful. This group develops leadership skills within its members through community service, professional, and social events that are planned internally. Members may receive a leadership position and learn more about the opportunities presented by the chapter through their Executive Board counterparts. First semester, you will have elections, career fairs, and your IVP will help you a lot. Second semester, the IVP will start letting the RT E-Board run meetings on their own. By this time, you will have run or have helped run a couple events as well as have gone to many E-Board events, so you will have an idea of how to prepare.</p> 
										<h3>EVENTS & ACTIVITIES</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Community Service </h4>
										<p>For this pillar, we chose to host a ChocolateSHPE Bake Sale for the 2016-2017. The money from this fundraiser was donated to the Boys & Girls Club in Urbana-Champaign. Each member was asked to donate a certain amount of cookies whether baked at home during Thanksgiving Break or at school. Our fundraiser happened on the Main Quad, targeted towards on-campus students. The extra cookies that were not sold were donated to the homeless people on Green Street. Event date: December 1st, 2016</p>
										<h4 class="major">Student/Professional Chapter Interaction </h4>
										<p>For this pillar, we work to get upperclassmen in SHPE, including the E-Board, other Hispanic RSOs, and friends to join together for a fundraiser called a Valentine’s Day Date Auction. The proceeds from this event help the RT buy attire at the end of the year (given to those who meet the ⅔ attendance quota). This event helps the RT to practice professionalism and look the part. The event consists of taking care of large amounts of money, so working beside the Treasurer, working with many members outside of SHPE, and reservations and logistics that need to be planned months ahead of time. Overall, this is one of the most known activities and one that members do not want to miss! There is dancing, music, money, and a photographer! Event date: February 11th, 2017</p>
										<h4 class="major">Outreach </h4>
										<p>The events that satisfy this pillar are the two High School Visitations that we host. One in the fall and spring semester. For this event we work with Outreach Committee to make ensure full participation from RT members. Each member is asked to commit some of their time to by going to at least one event during the weekend and to host a student (or two) if they live in a residence hall dorm. This event promotes higher education for Hispanic students in High School, and RT members are usually the most relatable to them having been in their positions the year prior or having attended HSV themselves. Event dates: November 10-12, 2016 & March 9-12th, 2017.</p>
										<h4 class="major">Academic Development </h4>
										<p>Study Lock-In, (March 12th)</p>
										<h4 class="major">Chapter Development </h4>
										<p>Family Visit Day, (April 8th)</p>
