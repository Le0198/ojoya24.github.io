										<h3>New Member Round Table</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Sundays | 5:00pm - 6:00pm </h4>
										<p>The Roundtable (RT) was created in the 1993-94 year in order to develop new SHPE members into leaders of the organization. The RT works by creating a microcosm of the chapter. It is composed of mainly freshman but is open to any new members. The committee then elects its own e-board. Elected RT members then work closely with their executive board counterparts to gain further insight and complete tasks assigned to them monthly. Throughout the school year, members of the RT, elected or not, think of and plan multiple events focused around SHPE's five pillars (Academics, Community Outreach, Chapter Development, Leadership and Professional Development). Examples of events the RT might organize are fundraisers, socials, and the chapter's annual date auction and family visit day. Through exposure to the way the eboard works and how events are planned the RT introduces new members to SHPE, its programs, and how to become a leader within SHPE.</p>

										<h3>External Committee</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Mondays | 5:00 - 6:00 pm</h4>
										<p>The External committee helps members develop the professional skills they need to obtain and excel at the internship, research, or full time position they want. It is in charge of building and maintaining relationships with top engineering companies, so our members can have the opportunity to interact with corporate representatives through various events.</p>
										<p>The committee organizes many events throughout the year, such as corporate sponsored general body meetings, company socials, and professional workshops to improve resumes and interviewing skills. The committee is responsible for obtaining sponsorship for our society from different corporations. It also invites our alumni to continue to be involved in our chapter through events like the Fall Tailgate and the End of Year Banquet.</p>

										<h3>Community Service</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Tuesdays | 7:00pm - 8:00pm </h4>
										<p>SHPE|UIUC Community Service Committee is a great way to not only get involved in SHPE but strive towards our goal of bettering the hispanic community. SHPE strives to change lives by empowering the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support and development. SHPE|UIUC Community Service accomplishes this through the variety of programs it hosts at all pre-college levels. In addition, SHPE|UIUC realizes the importance in giving back to the community that provides the chapter with so much. There is always room for anyone looking to make an impact so feel free to come by any committee meetings. We are always looking for new projects so free to share any opportunities you may know about in the community.</p>
