										<h3>New Member Round Table</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Sundays | 5:00pm - 6:00pm </h4>
										<p>The Roundtable (RT) was created in the 1993-94 year in order to develop new SHPE members into leaders of the organization. The RT works by creating a microcosm of the chapter. It is composed of mainly freshman but is open to any new members. The committee then elects its own e-board. Elected RT members then work closely with their executive board counterparts to gain further insight and complete tasks assigned to them monthly. Throughout the school year, members of the RT, elected or not, think of and plan multiple events focused around SHPE's five pillars (Academics, Community Outreach, Chapter Development, Leadership and Professional Development). Examples of events the RT might organize are fundraisers, socials, and the chapter's annual date auction and family visit day. Through exposure to the way the eboard works and how events are planned the RT introduces new members to SHPE, its programs, and how to become a leader within SHPE.</p>

										<h3>External Committee</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Mondays | 5:00 - 6:00 pm</h4>
										<p>The External committee helps members develop the professional skills they need to obtain and excel at the internship, research, or full time position they want. It is in charge of building and maintaining relationships with top engineering companies, so our members can have the opportunity to interact with corporate representatives through various events.</p>
										<p>The committee organizes many events throughout the year, such as corporate sponsored general body meetings, company socials, and professional workshops to improve resumes and interviewing skills. The committee is responsible for obtaining sponsorship for our society from different corporations. It also invites our alumni to continue to be involved in our chapter through events like the Fall Tailgate and the End of Year Banquet.</p>

										<h3>Community Service</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Tuesdays | 7:00pm - 8:00pm </h4>
										<p>SHPE|UIUC Community Service Committee is a great way to not only get involved in SHPE but strive towards our goal of bettering the hispanic community. SHPE strives to change lives by empowering the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support and development. SHPE|UIUC Community Service accomplishes this through the variety of programs it hosts at all pre-college levels. In addition, SHPE|UIUC realizes the importance in giving back to the community that provides the chapter with so much. There is always room for anyone looking to make an impact so feel free to come by any committee meetings. We are always looking for new projects so free to share any opportunities you may know about in the community.</p>

										<h3>High School Outreach</h3>
										<p>Currently, the United States is facing a shortage of individuals in STEM fields. Compared to our counterparts, the U.S. has significantly fewer graduates entering STEM jobs year in and year out. Additionally, our K -12 students test below their international counterparts in math and science. If these trends continue, America will fall short of producing the innovators that are needed to address the issues of the 21st century.</p>
										<p>Research states that Hispanics will be the majority population in the United States by 2040. Hispanic students need to be prepared to compete in the STEM fields that are projected to have the highest need for new hires. SHPE's mission is to empower the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support and development.</p>
										<p>Through the programs that the Outreach Committee organizes, SHPE will inspire the next generation of innovators this country needs! SHPE|UIUC aims to motivate minority students to pursue a higher education and increase the quantity of minorities in STEM fields.</p>

										<h3>Technical Projects</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Sundays | 2:00pm - 3:00pm </h4>
										<p>SHPE's Technical committee was founded with the purpose of exposing Engineers to real world problems and projects. Each year SHPE's Technical committee takes on on multiple projects ranging from robots for the Jerry Sanders Design Competition to smaller Engineering Open House exhibits. The technical Committe is where a lot of students get their first taste of hands on engineering that will serve them well in their careers.<p>
										<p>The Technical Committee is currently working on 4 projects this year. The projects will be displayed in the Engineering Open House, EOH, at the University of Illinois. During EOH, the projects will be displayed in the Mechanical Engineering Building.</p>
										<p>The first project is that of a mechanically programmable robot, Heron Robot, which was inspired by Heron of Alexandria. We have already built the first prototype in order to show the proof of concept. The first robot was mainly built with wood. There were some components that were made out of HIPS plastic and acrylic. The parts were manufactured mainly by using the wood shop equipment - miter saw, table saw, and drill press - in the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. We are currently working on fixing a few issues that the first prototype brought to light. The first problem is the traction between the wheels and the floor is not high enough to do advanced movements, such as turning the robot with both the wheels turning in different directions. Another issue is with manufacturing the robot with tighter tolerances. The next Heron Robot will be made with mainly HIPS Plastic and acrylic. The parts will be manufactured, by using the 3D printers and the laser cutters, in the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. This will ensure that the parts have smaller tolerances. Metal shafts, shaft holders, and bearings have been bought in order to improve the frictional losses of the previous Heron Robot.</p>
