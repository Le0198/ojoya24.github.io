										<h3>New Member Round Table</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Sundays | 5:00pm - 6:00pm </h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span><h3>What does the New Member Roundtable Do?</h3>
										<p>The New Member Roundtable is the introductory committee that consists primarily of freshmen and sophomores. It is the responsibility and tradition of the New Member Roundtable to fulfill the five pillars of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. The RT works alongside their Internal Vice-President, each other and from previous RTâ€™s to make their events successful. This group develops leadership skills within its members through community service, professional, and social events that are planned internally. Members may receive a leadership position and learn more about the opportunities presented by the chapter through their Executive Board counterparts. First semester, you will have elections, career fairs, and your IVP will help you a lot. Second semester, the IVP will start letting the RT E-Board run meetings on their own. By this time, you will have run or have helped run a couple events as well as have gone to many E-Board events, so you will have an idea of how to prepare.</p>

										<h3>External Committee</h3>
										<h4 class="major">Mondays | 5:00 - 6:00 pm</h4>
										<p>The External committee helps members develop the professional skills they need to obtain and excel at the internship, research, or full time position they want. It is in charge of building and maintaining relationships with top engineering companies, so our members can have the opportunity to interact with corporate representatives through various events.</p>
										<p>The committee organizes many events throughout the year, such as corporate sponsored general body meetings, company socials, and professional workshops to improve resumes and interviewing skills. The committee is responsible for obtaining sponsorship for our society from different corporations. It also invites our alumni to continue to be involved in our chapter through events like the Fall Tailgate and the End of Year Banquet.</p>
